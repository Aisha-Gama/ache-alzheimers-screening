## 🧠 About This Project

### What Am I Doing?
I am using computer-based methods to study **12 natural plant compounds (phytochemicals)** to see if any could help prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease. Instead of performing expensive lab experiments, I'm using **computational screening** to predict which natural compounds might best inhibit an enzyme linked to memory loss — *acetylcholinesterase (AChE)*.

### Personal Motivation
My grandmother’s journey with Alzheimer’s changed my life. Watching her gradually forget the people she loved — including me — made me determined to understand the brain and the diseases that affect it. This project is my first step toward that goal.  

Through this research, I want to discover whether **natural, food-based compounds** could help reduce or prevent Alzheimer’s disease. My ultimate goal is to contribute to scientific understanding and help families like mine have hope for better treatments in the future.

### Why Is This Important?
Alzheimer’s disease affects millions of people worldwide. One key problem is the loss of acetylcholine — a neurotransmitter vital for memory and learning. The enzyme **acetylcholinesterase (AChE)** breaks it down too quickly, worsening cognitive decline.

**Current Alzheimer’s drugs have major drawbacks:**
- ❌ Limited effectiveness  
- ❌ Side effects  
- ❌ High cost  

**Natural compounds may offer better alternatives because:**
- ✅ They’re derived from plants (often used in traditional medicine)  
- ✅ They’re generally safer and more affordable  
- ✅ Some can cross the blood–brain barrier naturally  
- ✅ They may have fewer side effects  

---

## ⚙️ How Am I Doing It?
I’m using three main computational tools:
1. **ChemDraw** – to draw molecular structures of each phytochemical  
2. **PyRx** – for molecular docking, to test how well each compound fits into AChE  
3. **Discovery Studio** – to analyze binding interactions and predict drug-like properties

## 🌿 The 12 Phytochemicals I’m Studying

| Compound | Common Source |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Apigenin** | Chamomile, Parsley |
| **Baicalein** | Scutellaria baicalensis (Chinese skullcap) |
| **Berberine** | Goldenseal, Barberry |
| **Carnosic Acid** | Rosemary, Sage |
| **Curcumin** | Turmeric |
| **Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG)** | Green Tea |
| **Fisetin** | Strawberries, Apples |
| **Huperzine A** | Chinese Club Moss |
| **Luteolin** | Celery, Green Peppers |
| **Quercetin** | Onions, Apples |
| **Resveratrol** | Grapes, Red Wine |
| **Sulforaphane** | Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts |

These compounds were selected from scientific literature for their known **neuroprotective and antioxidant properties**.

---

## 🔍 What I’m Looking For
I aim to identify compounds that:
- Bind strongly to **acetylcholinesterase (AChE)**  
- Can **cross the blood–brain barrier**  
- Show **low predicted toxicity**  
- Are **naturally available** in foods or plants  

---

## 🚧 My Progress
**Current Status:** 🔄 Work in Progress  

- ✅ Selected 12 phytochemicals based on neuroprotective potential  
- ✅ Created 2D and 3D structures using ChemDraw  
- ✅ Downloaded and cleaned human AChE structure (PDB ID: 4EY7)  
- ✅ Prepared all ligand and protein files for docking  
- 🔄 Running molecular docking simulations in PyRx  
- ⏳ Analyzing binding energies and interactions  
- ⏳ Writing up results and findings  

**Expected Completion:** December 2024  

---

## 🎯 Research Goals
**Primary Goal:** Identify food-based plant compounds that can naturally inhibit AChE and may help prevent Alzheimer’s disease.

**Secondary Goals:**
- Learn computational drug discovery techniques  
- Build a strong foundation in neurochemistry and pharmacology  
- Contribute to the global search for affordable Alzheimer’s treatments  
- Raise awareness about natural neuroprotective foods

## 🧪 Tools and Software

| Software | Purpose | 
|-----------|----------|------|
| ChemDraw | Draw and convert molecular structures | 
| PyRx | Virtual screening and molecular docking | 
| ChimeraX | 3D protein visualization |
| Discovery Studio | Drug-likeness and ADMET predictions | 
| SwissADME | Online prediction of pharmacokinetic properties |

## 🧬 The Target: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
**What it is:** A brain enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine — the “memory molecule.”  
**Why it matters:** In Alzheimer’s, this enzyme is overactive, reducing acetylcholine levels and impairing memory.  
**Protein used:** Human AChE (PDB ID: **4EY7**)  

**Preparation Steps:**
- Removed the existing inhibitor (donepezil)  
- Optimized the structure for docking  
- Defined the active binding pocket for the 12 compounds  

---

## 📊 Expected Results
By the end of this project, I aim to identify:
- The **top 3–5 compounds** with the strongest binding affinity to AChE  
- Their **key molecular interactions** with the enzyme  
- Whether they could **cross into the brain** (blood–brain barrier predictions)  
- Their **safety and natural availability**  

These insights can guide future **laboratory validation studies** and inspire dietary recommendations or plant-based therapeutic exploration.
